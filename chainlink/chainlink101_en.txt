Do you event Link, bro? [Introductory][No-Code][2-min read]

Who is this for? anybody who wants a fast, non-too-technical intro to the company.

I know your time is valuable. This is why this article is purposely short, so you can get in and out quickly. Here, I’ll explain what Chainlink really is because - I kid you not! -, Chainlink is much more than the spoon-feeding hand that delivers the Bitcoin price to your app. Future articles will go more in-depth into Chainlink services as well as Chainlink 2.0. 

TL,DR
Chainlink allows you to :
-get off-chain data, 
-monetize your data or API, 
-safely generate random numbers, 
-automate smart contract executions, 
-monitor asset reserves, 
-off-load computation and save on gas costs. 
Adding to all of that, soon you will be able to communicate and initiate actions across multiple networks.

Now, let’s go over a few points:
Where is Chainlink coming from?
What problems Chainlink is resolving,
What tools Chainlink is currently offering,
What about the Link token?
Existing use-cases where Chainlink is used

Where is Chainlink coming from?
A decade ago when blockchain was still in its baby state, Sergey Nazarov was working on building secure blockchain messaging and he realised that most developers were working on private key signing, token ledger and state changes within the EVM. So he decided to work on building oracles to go beyond those aforementioned capabilities. 

What problems Chainlink is tackling?
1- The obvious one: getting external data. Your app needs to know the temperature in Alaska [https://docs.chain.link/docs/google-weather/], the price of Bitcoin, which football team won the match last night, whatever data it is you need Chainlink creates a bridge between the source of the information and your application. 

2- Creating random numbers: you might be surprised to learn that there is actually a ton of apps that require random numbers in their code, either for core functionalities or for security, in all industries: banking, gaming, designing, etc.. but you can not create a safe random number on-chain because of the consensus mechanism: all nodes in the network need to agree on the value of that number, which means they would all have to create it the exact same way. That would make it quite predictable ay?

3- Reducing gas cost and extending blockchain capabilities: on-chain computation is expensive, so to lower the bill, Chainlink brings all that heavy lifting off-chain, where it can perform gasless computation and also provides the requesting blockchain with more resources.

4- Allowing transfer of assets and communication between smart contracts stored in different blockchains. Here, we enter the “interoperability and composition capabilities” territory. 
In a nutshell, Chainlink is working on a fast and secure protocol that would allow you or your application to send and receive any asset from any blockchain and beyond that, you could assemble pieces of code taken from multiple blockchains into your smart contract. 

What tools Chainlink is currently offering?

Those Issues have led to the creation of the following services:
-Market and Data Feeds - not only can you ask Chainlink for data but you can also make a good buck by selling your own data and connecting your API to the network,
-Modular External Adapters for connecting to any off-chain resource,
-VRF (Verifiable Random Function) - to provide verifiable randomness,
-Keepers - to securely automate your smart contracts,
-Proof of Reserve (PoR) - to monitor reserves of assets,
-Off-Chain Computation services (Fair Sequencing Services, DECO, Arbitrum Rollups, and more),
-Cross-Chain Bridging (CCIP) - to send messages, transfer tokens, and initiate actions across multiple networks.

More details on all those services in future articles.

Use-cases where Chainlink is used:
- Aave uses Price Feeds to ensure proper collateralization,
- SWIFT used Chainlink oracles to aggregate interest rates from five major banks, fetch debt score data from S&P to generate interest payments,
- TrustToken uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to provide smart contracts proof of the off-chain fiat reserves backing the TUSD stablecoin,
- Trey Mancini’s NFTs use Chainlink VRF to randomly assign additional utilities,
- Visor Finance uses Keepers to rebalance liquidity position on Uniswap V3 when predefined thresholds are crossed,
- Synthetic also uses Keepers to automate the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards each week.
And many many more…
